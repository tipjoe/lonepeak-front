# Lonepeak - Front End

This (`lonepeak-front`) is the angular front end repository that works together with `lonepeak-api`
(Laravel back end api).

Lonepeak is micro-community software that helps neighbors meet and do stuff
together. It all starts with "giving a crap" about each other. Here's a short
[video where Grumpy Cat helps you see the idea] (https://youtu.be/4ncsM6Beb8A)
(though it's a bit outdated).

This is open source software that anyone can use freely. It's a volunteer
passion project. When we get time, we'll create some instructions to use it.
If your neighborhood is interested in using it but you don't have a technical
person to help, we may be able to refer you to someone who can help for a
fee but we don't manage it.

If you've started learning software development and would like to build your
resume by contributing to a "real" project, let's talk. Just create an
issue here in github (on this repo) and we'll be in touch.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
